# Facies Classification Using Machine Learning
## Project Overview

This repository contains the work completed for the PETE 419/686 course on Petroleum Data Analytics and Machine Learning at Texas A&M University, under the guidance of Associate Professor Sid Misra. The primary objective of this project is to develop various machine learning classifiers to perform facies classification on the Volve Dataset, focusing on lithology identification using well log data.
